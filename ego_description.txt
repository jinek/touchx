Touch screen ( touchscreen ) accessibility with touch feedback and OSK button. 
Currently supports ripple feedback where the screen is touched. You can enable/disable the touch-feedback and set its size, duration and color as you see fit.
Additionally, you can add a toggle button in the panel to force enable or force disable On Screen Keyboard ( OSK ). 
- When enabled, the OSK will pop up in input fields or with Gnome supported gestures. 
- When disabled, the OSK will not pop up at all. 
This works regardless of Touchscreen Accessibility settings and regardless of whether the screen is in touch mode or not ( laptop vs tablet etc ).

Note: Gnome 45 version is up! I am unable to do a proper test for 45 with VM, so please try and let me know if any issues.
